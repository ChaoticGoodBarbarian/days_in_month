Write a program that outputs the number of days in a month based on the given month number and year.

**Input Format:**  
Two positive integers: the month number (1–12) and a four-digit year.

**Output Format:**  
Print a single number — the number of days in the specified month.

**Example 1**  
Input: `1 2001`  
Output: `31`

**Example 2**  
Input: `2 2001`  
Output: `28`

**Note:**  
It is recommended to first solve the “Leap Year” problem and use its logic to determine the number of days in February.
